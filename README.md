## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity and comments in the source code** | The code is organized and commented in a way that facilitates reading and understanding.                                                                                  |
| **Functionality and stability**             | The game runs without bugs or crashes, providing a smooth experience.                                                                                                     |
| **Use of state machines**                   | The student integrates one or more state machines to manage the behaviors of elements and/or the game states (Menus, gameplay, etc.).                                     |
| **Rotations and aiming**                    | The student masters basic trigonometric functions for movement and the rotation of gameplay elements (Sine, Cosine, distance, angle calculation).                         |
| **Use of lists**                            | The game integrates the use of lists to manage different elements of the game (objects, enemies, etc.) and facilitates the creation of complex game mechanics.            |
| **Multiple scenes**                         | The game includes several scenes (Menu, gameplay, pause, etc.).                                                                                                           |
| **Modular code**                            | The code is divided into modules to facilitate understanding, reuse, and maintenance.                                                                                     |
| **Dependency injection**                    | The student uses dependency injection to facilitate communication and interaction between different modules.                                                              |
| **Clear presentation of the project**       | The student can provide a structured description of the project and explain the design choices.                                                                           |
| **Technical and conceptual mastery**        | The student demonstrates mastery of fundamental concepts (loops, expressions, control structures, functions) and the language used in the project by answering questions. |
